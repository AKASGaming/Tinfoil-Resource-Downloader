# Tinfoil Resource Downloader

A program used to download Icons and Banners (and maybe screenshots) of Switch Games using Tinfoil in a nice little GUI ðŸ˜ƒ

_(This was pretty much just going to be a proof-of-concept type program, but it's slowly evolving)_

Currently, the program takes the ID of a Switch game, and only returns the Name, ID, and Icon for the given ID. In a future update, you'll be able to download Icons, Banners, and hopefully, Screenshots, like you see on the Tinfoil website.

Tested on Windows 10 & Windows 11

# If anyone would like to help out, feel free to do a PR, I'll take a look at it and most likely merge it!  
Currently I'm trying to find a good and easy interface for this entire thing.
