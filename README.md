# Tinfoil Resource Downloader
 A program used to download Icons and Banners (and maybe screenshots) of Switch Games using Tinfoil in a nice little GUI ðŸ˜ƒ

Currentky, the program takes the ID of a Switch game, and only returns the Name, ID, and Icon for the given ID. In a future update, you'll be able to download Icons, Banners, and hopefully Screenshots, like you see on the Tinfoil website.
